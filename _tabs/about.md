Geekujin is the digital construct of a carbon based humanoid from the North East of England. He is a Cyber Security professional for an organisation that provides valuable services to the local community.

I'm a strong privacy and open technology advocate, believing that everybody has the right to not have their physical and digital selves under constant scrutiny from shadowy government and corpo dictators.

This site will likely contain political commentary, predominantly around the impact of social media in minimising and oppressing minority groups, and the pervasive use of technology to strip away peoples privacy by tech giants such as Google, Meta, and X. I'll also post other stuff which is more cyber security focused.

Basically, this will act as a bit of a brain dump for thoughts, code snippets and other long form posts that don't belong on Discord or Mastodon, which is pretty much my primary social media presence.

## What am I up to?

My current albums, TV shows, films, books etc. that I've been consuming, or anything specifically I'm working on can be found on my [now page](https://geekujin.net/now), once I've got round to building it, inspired by [nownownow](https://nownownow.com/about).

Or maybe I'll abandon that idea and stick it in a post or something. Who knows?
